## Execution Plan for Cryptocurrency Market Sentiment & Price Data 2025 Analysis

### 1. Data Loading
- **Objective**: Load the raw dataset into a suitable format for analysis.
- **Script**: `src/data/load_data.py`
- **Steps**:
  - Import necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy).
  - Define a function to read the raw data files from the `data/raw` directory.
  - Handle any missing values or inconsistencies during loading.
  - Save the loaded data into a DataFrame for further processing.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Objective**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
- **Script**: `src/data/preprocess.py`
- **Steps**:
  - Import the loaded data from the previous step.
  - Perform data cleaning (e.g., removing duplicates, handling missing values).
  - Normalize and transform features as necessary (e.g., scaling numerical features).
  - Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.
  - Save the processed data into the `data/processed` directory.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Objective**: Understand the dataset through visualizations and summary statistics.
- **Notebook**: `notebooks/01-exploratory-data-analysis.ipynb`
- **Steps**:
  - Load the processed data.
  - Generate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.).
  - Create visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots) to identify trends and patterns.
  - Analyze correlations between sentiment scores and price movements.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- **Objective**: Enhance the dataset with additional features for modeling.
- **Notebook**: `notebooks/02-feature-engineering.ipynb`
- **Steps**:
  - Identify potential new features (e.g., moving averages, sentiment scores).
  - Implement feature extraction techniques.
  - Create new features based on existing data (e.g., lagged variables).
  - Save the enhanced dataset for modeling.

### 5. Sentiment Analysis
- **Objective**: Assess market sentiment based on textual data.
- **Script**: `src/analysis/sentiment_analysis.py`
- **Steps**:
  - Load relevant textual data (e.g., news articles, social media posts).
  - Implement sentiment analysis using libraries like TextBlob or VADER.
  - Integrate sentiment scores into the main dataset.
  - Analyze the impact of sentiment on price movements.

### 6. Model Training
- **Objective**: Train machine learning models to predict cryptocurrency prices.
- **Script**: `src/models/modeling.py`
- **Steps**:
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Select appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, LSTM).
  - Train models using the training set.
  - Tune hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search.

### 7. Model Evaluation
- **Objective**: Evaluate model performance and select the best model.
- **Steps**:
  - Use metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared to assess model performance.
  - Compare results across different models.
  - Visualize model predictions against actual values.

### 8. Reporting Findings
- **Objective**: Summarize the analysis and present findings.
- **Document**: `reports/final_report.md`
- **Steps**:
  - Compile insights from EDA, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
  - Create visualizations to support findings.
  - Write a comprehensive report detailing methodologies, results, and recommendations.

### 9. Deployment
- **Objective**: Deploy the model for real-time predictions.
- **Script**: `scripts/run_pipeline.sh`
- **Steps**:
  - Automate the entire workflow from data loading to model evaluation.
  - Ensure the script can be executed in a production environment.
  - Document deployment steps and requirements.

### 10. Future Work
- **Objective**: Identify areas for further research and analysis.
- **Ideas**:
  - Explore additional data sources (e.g., macroeconomic indicators).
  - Investigate advanced modeling techniques (e.g., ensemble methods).
  - Conduct scenario simulations to predict future market conditions.
