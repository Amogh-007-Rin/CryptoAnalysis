## Step-by-Step Plan for Analyzing the "Cryptocurrency Market Sentiment & Price Data 2025" Dataset

### 1. Data Exploration
   - **Objective**: Understand the structure and contents of the dataset.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Load the dataset from the raw data directory.
     - Perform initial data inspection (head, info, describe).
     - Identify missing values and data types.
     - Visualize the distribution of key variables (price, sentiment scores).
   - **Expected Outcomes**: A comprehensive overview of the dataset, including data quality issues and initial insights.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
   - **Objective**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Handle missing values (imputation or removal).
     - Normalize and scale numerical features.
     - Encode categorical variables if necessary.
     - Create new features based on existing data (e.g., moving averages).
   - **Expected Outcomes**: A cleaned and transformed dataset ready for analysis.

### 3. Feature Selection
   - **Objective**: Identify the most relevant features for modeling.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Use correlation analysis to identify relationships between features.
     - Apply feature importance techniques (e.g., Random Forest, Lasso).
     - Conduct recursive feature elimination (RFE) to refine feature set.
   - **Expected Outcomes**: A reduced set of features that contribute significantly to the predictive power of the model.

### 4. Statistical Analysis
   - **Objective**: Conduct exploratory statistical analysis to uncover patterns.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Perform hypothesis testing to validate assumptions.
     - Analyze trends over time using time series analysis.
     - Investigate the relationship between sentiment and price movements.
   - **Expected Outcomes**: Statistical insights that inform modeling decisions.

### 5. Machine Learning Model Selection
   - **Objective**: Choose appropriate models for prediction.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Evaluate various algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, LSTM).
     - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
     - Train multiple models and compare their performance using cross-validation.
   - **Expected Outcomes**: A shortlist of models with their performance metrics.

### 6. Model Validation Techniques
   - **Objective**: Ensure the robustness of the selected models.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Implement k-fold cross-validation.
     - Use metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² for evaluation.
     - Analyze residuals to check for patterns.
   - **Expected Outcomes**: Validation results that confirm model reliability.

### 7. Reporting Findings
   - **Objective**: Summarize the analysis and present insights.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create visualizations to illustrate key findings.
     - Write a comprehensive report detailing methodologies, results, and recommendations.
     - Prepare a presentation for stakeholders.
   - **Expected Outcomes**: A final report and presentation that effectively communicate the analysis results.

### 8. Future Work and Extensions
   - **Objective**: Identify areas for further research and analysis.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Suggest additional data sources for enhanced analysis.
     - Explore advanced modeling techniques (e.g., ensemble methods).
     - Consider scenario simulations for predictive insights.
   - **Expected Outcomes**: A roadmap for future analysis and potential improvements.
